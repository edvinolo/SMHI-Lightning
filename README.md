Downloads and processes open lightning data from SMHI, the Swedish national weather service.

It is possible to create a map of all recorded lightning strikes within a given period. The map is color coded by the density of strikes in the given region.

The data can also be used to train a binary classifier, that can determine based on the other available parameters if the lightning strike was cloud-to-cloud or cloud-to-ground.
