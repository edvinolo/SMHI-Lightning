Planning document for lightning data

Goals:
    [x] Download and read lightning data from SMHI API
    [] Find nice ways to vizualize the data
        [X] Plot the number of strikes as function of day of year
        [x] Map of all strikes and neighbor count
        [] Calculate number of days with lightning strikes for major cities
    [x] Find out if a model can be trained to predict cloud-to-cloud or cloud-to-ground discharge (prediction or classification?)
        [] try to make a neural net!

Problems:
    [](?) Speed of neighbors calculation for large data sets. Chunks seem to work the best on this computer.
    [] Neighbor count is of by 1 between loop and array_trickery for certain data points, currently not clear what is causing this to happen

To do:
    [] Clean up, and document/comment code
    [] Separate code into modules
